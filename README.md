# ContextAI — Agentic Orchestration Framework for Autonomous Data Analysis

ContextAI is a fully autonomous, multi-agent data analysis framework that transforms raw, multi-format datasets into complete analytical reports—without any manual intervention.
It integrates LLM-driven semantic reasoning, deterministic statistical engines, and a LangGraph-based state machine to deliver an end-to-end data analytics workflow.

# 🚀 Key Features
# 🔹 Multi-Agent Architecture

A coordinated pipeline of specialized agents:

Data Steward — Multi-format data ingestion (CSV, Excel, JSON, PDF, text).

Data Janitor — Intelligent data cleaning using LLM-guided strategies.

Data Explorer — Semantic profiling, domain detection & question generation.

Insight Analyst — Hybrid analysis engine combining LLM reasoning with statistical computation, forecasting, and visualization.

Report Writer — Automatic PDF report creation with insights and embedded graphs.

All agents collaborate using a shared LangGraph state machine that maintains session context.
